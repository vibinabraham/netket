def estimate_expectations(
    ops, sampler, n_samples, n_discard=None, compute_gradients=False
):
    """
    For a sequence of linear operators, computes a statistical estimate of the
    respective expectation values, variances, and optionally gradients of the
    expectation values with respect to the variational parameters.

    The estimate is based on `n_samples` configurations
    obtained from `sampler`.

    Args:
        ops: pytree of linear operators
        sampler: A NetKet sampler
        n_samples: Number of MC samples used to estimate expectation values
        n_discard: Number of MC samples dropped from the start of the
            chain (burn-in). Defaults to `n_samples //10`.
        compute_gradients: Whether to compute the gradients of the
            observables.

    Returns:
        Either `stats` or, if `der_logs` is passed, a tuple of `stats` and `grad`:
            stats: A sequence of Stats object containing mean, variance,
                and MC diagonstics for each operator in `ops`.
            grad: A sequence of gradients of the expectation value of `op`,
                  as ndarray of shape `(psi.n_par,)`, for each `op` in `ops`.
